## Importance of Using Semantics in our HTML:
### 1. We use semantics in HTML for the following Reasons:

**Clarity and Readability:** Provides meaningful structure as well as improving the overall readability of the HTML code. 
Semantics tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>etc., makes the understanding of the purpose and structure of the content easier for developers and other stakeholders. 

**Accessibility:** Semantic elements enhance accessibility by providing built-in meaning to assistive technologies and search engines. Screen readers, for example, can interpret semantic tags more accurately and provide better context to visually impaired users. Search engines also use semantic markup to understand and index web pages more effectively.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand the content and relevance of web pages, thereby leading to better search engine rankings and visibility.

**Future-proofing and Maintainability:** Semantic elements are less likely to be affected by changes in styling or layout. Even if the visual presentation changes, the underlying semantic structure remains intact. This makes the code more maintainable and adaptable to future design updates.

**Interoperability and Integration:** Semantic HTML promotes interoperability with other technologies and platforms. It allows for easier integration with CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, content management systems (CMS), and other tools that rely on standardized HTML structure.

### 2. In HTML, there are six levels of headings. 
These are represented by the <h1> to <h6> elements which each indicating a different level of importance or hierarchy in the document structure. 

<h1>: Represents the highest level heading, typically used for the main title or heading of the page.
<h2>: Represents a second-level heading, used for major sections or subsections of the content.
<h3>: Represents a third-level heading, used for sub-sections within the major sections.
<h4>: Represents a fourth-level heading, used for sub-sections within the third-level headings.
<h5>: Represents a fifth-level heading, used for sub-sections within the fourth-level headings.
<h6>: Represents the lowest level heading, used for minor sub-sections or details within the content.

### 3. The <sup> and <sub> elements:
In HTML The <sup> and <sub> elements are used to represent superscript and subscript text, respectively. 

<sup> (Superscript):

**Mathematical notations:**
Superscript numbers or symbols, such as exponents or indices, can be represented using <sup> tags. For example, x^2 can be written as x<sup>2</sup>.
**Footnotes and references:**
Superscript numbers or letters are often used to indicate footnotes or reference links. The corresponding footnote or reference text can be placed at the bottom of the page or in a separate section.
**Trademark and copyright symbols:** Superscript symbols, like the trademark (™) or copyright (©) symbols, can be represented using <sup> tags.


<sub> (Subscript):
**Chemical formulas:**
Subscripts are commonly used in chemical formulas to represent the number of atoms or elements. For example, H2O (water) can be written as H<sub>2</sub>O.
**Mathematical expressions:**
Subscripts can be used to represent variables or indices in mathematical equations. For example, a<sub>n</sub> represents the nth term in a sequence.
**Abbreviations and acronyms:**
Subscripts can be used in abbreviations or acronyms to represent specific letters or characters. For example, CO<sub>2</sub> represents carbon dioxide.

### 3. The <abbr> element in HTML:
When you using this, a full expansion of the term using the title attribute can be provided. The title attribute is used to specify additional information about an element, and in the case of <abbr>, it is used to provide the full expansion or explanation of the abbreviated term. For example:
<p>HTML is an abbreviation for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
When a user hovers over the 'abbr'the full meaning is displated. 

How CSS Is Structured.

What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
Why should we avoid using inline styles?
Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
What is representing the selector?

   }
